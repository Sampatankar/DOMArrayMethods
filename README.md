# DOMArrayMethods
5/20: DOM Array to UI - 20 vanillaJS projects

This app will look at rendering to the UI, a database with names, and figures stating their wealth.  This app will use: forEach(), map(), sort(), filter() and reduce() array methods to do things with that data, and render it to the UI.

This application is from section 5 of Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects in vanilla JS course on Udemy.com

This tutorial has been done with the aim to refactor the code in React later on.
